## 📊 SQL-HR Analytics Projects

This section showcases my SQL proficiency through real-world queries and schema analysis using a simulated HR database.

### 🔹 Project: HR Analytics using SQL

**Schema**: Based on a typical HR setup – employees, departments, jobs, locations.

**Tools Used**: MySQL Workbench
